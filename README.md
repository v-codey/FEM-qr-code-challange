# Overview
  Nothing much to say about so added some lorem ipsum to fill the space. 
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Velit mollitia amet quis eligendi obcaecati cum sed unde, quos tenetur? Aliquam quaerat, optio dolores aperiam quas repellat eum repellendus quod explicabo voluptate quasi corporis magni minima corrupti eligendi adipisci 
  nemo doloribus recusandae impedit assumenda laborum velit fugiat distinctio obcaecati.


### Screenshot

![screenshot](/design/screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
In this challange I learned about the property of CSS flexbox and various other things i.e. 
- positioning of element
- proper indentation & spacing 
- font size should not used with pixel instead use of em, rem is encouraged
- width of element should be avoided to be hard-coded for better apperance in different screen sizes


```html
<h1 class="sr-only">Frontend Mentor | QR code component </h1>
```
```css
body{
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
    background-color: var(--light-gray);
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    width: 100%;
}

```
